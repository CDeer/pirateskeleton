Here it is located a more in-depth view of mechanics and systems. Basically, what variables and how it should work.

Fully turn based COMBAT
three 'classes'
	Hero
	Enemy
	Admin

uses two lists
	Field heroes.
	Field enemies.
uses a grid
	Turn order
Field heroes is pulled from the current party list.
Field enemies is pulled/built randomly from the zone's spawn table.

turn order iterates and loops. 0 to max.
when current turnorder iteration overlaps with field heroes then the hud is controllable and actions can be done.
there is no progress in turn order until an action is made.

there's an action variable and a turn variable. once an action is made (action == true) then the turn passes.
Inputs will be managed by a separate script. they'll iterate through a list that'll compose the GUI.
actions will be made from the admin, reading from the instance's stats and executing scripts according to what's input.
